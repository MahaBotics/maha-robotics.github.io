# I am Maha, and I love robots 🤖

Professionally, I work on **robot motion planning, control, and simulation**.

I am currently building a **robot rabbit** that can hop around and spread joy.
If that sounds interesting, feel free to check it out — I’d love to discuss it.

Below are some **selected projects** from my professional and personal journey.
